        Introduction

      <p>
        Hi, my name is Isaac Arcia and I'm an electronic engineer and self taught developer. During the pandemic in 2020, in my first year of college, I attended the in-person course CS50x.ni. Having completed the course successfully (see my certificate) I ended up developing a passion for anything coding related and thus have gathered tons of experience, but mostly from hobby-ish projects.
      </p>

        My actual work experience comes from as little as (almost) two years ago when I worked along a cousin of mine for a local financial institution, developing a new system for managing client loans among other things. Since then, I've been working on and off as a freelancer for other local companies. Now, as I'm about to graduate, I'm looking for a more stable, remote job as a Full-stack developer. If you like what you see here and have an open position at your company, I'd love to hear from you.
